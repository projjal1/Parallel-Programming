# Parallel-Programming

Repo containing codes for Parallel programming in C using OpenMP and CUDA libraries.

OpenMP is a library which parallelizes section of code via CPU threads on the system. OpenMP is based on UMA architecture with multiple CPU cores sharing a common memory.

CUDA is a library which parallelizes section of code via GPU cores. CUDA works with capable NVIDIA gpu and can achieve much higher paralellization than existing libraries.

Dask is a multi-programming library in Python that parallelizes task.
